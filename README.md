# Omni-FEM

The development repository for the Omni-FEM simulator

The simulator is still under construction

Please see wiki for more inforation

# Requirements

Must have wxWidgets v3.0.2 installed
Must have support for openGL V2.1

# Notes

A helpful tool, the project was built using the Code Lite IDE. It can be downloaded here: http://downloads.codelite.org/
For building the project, run the command:

sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev

This will get the OpenGL libraries. Double check compiler settings to make sure that -lglut, -lGL, and -lGLU are placed in their approiate places (This does matter).

To install wxwidgets, follow these instructions:
http://codelite.org/LiteEditor/WxWidgets30Binaries

The icons that are used by the UI are the default kde4 icons that are suppose to be located in the folder /usr/share/icons
