/* The purpose of this file will be to create the canvas to which the user will need to interact with
 * This class will contain an object(s) that will contain most of the definitions of the physics problem.
 * For example, this class will containt the list of boundary conditions, material properties, etc.
 * The reason for this desgin was that it would be easier for data access when the user needs to manipulate
 * the data or whent he user needs to set lines or nodes to specific sets of data.
 * Other methods invovled creating a custom class which can be tricky
